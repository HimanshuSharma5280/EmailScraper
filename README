Script will parse a website and find the e-mail addresses using REGEX.
Next release will follow a variable number of links on the website to aide in scanning and entire website rather than one page.

Usage:
Using python 3.7, execute emailScrape.py
Enter website to scrape
a=input("emter your gmail ID")
import from [gmail.com]
   search=search(a)
   pass
open:
 (gmail.com\unread)
E-mails will output to screen

TODO:
** Enable scanning of entire website and not just a single page
** Output to a file named after the URL
